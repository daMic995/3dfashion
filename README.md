## Introduction

This is a hybrid Next.js + Python app that uses Next.js as the frontend and Flask as the API backend. This project involves building a web app that provides a user-friendly 3D clothes design web application that can be used as a means of sending designs to tailors and sharing to a community of designers. Utilizing an AI-powered body measurement tool, a user's body measurements is used to create a 3D model that reflects their 3D-selves on which they can style and design clothes on and connect with a tailor from the websites platform to get the final outfit.
